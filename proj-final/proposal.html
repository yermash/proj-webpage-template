	<h1>Stylistic Shaders in Unity</h1>
	<h3>Uri Kreindler, Gabriel Mitnick, Brandon Suen, and Brandon Yermash</h3>
	<p>We will create a number of different non-photorealistic shaders in Unity and combine them into a demo scene. We will potentially create a single shader that is more complex and detailed to showcase the scene.</p>
	<p><em>Question for TA&rsquo;s: Would it be okay if we used Unity&rsquo;s visual programming &ldquo;shader graph&rdquo; tool? Or should we use only Cg/HLSL code? Or a mix of the two?</em></p>

	<h2>Problem Description</h2>
	<p>Just because a renderer has optimal physically accurate doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s optimal for a specific application. In animations, static art, and interactive art like videogames, non-physically accurate shaders might give more desirable results. How can we go beyond the aesthetic value of physically-based rendering by making more stylized, unrealistic algorithms? We&rsquo;ll approach this intersection of computer science and art by writing shaders for Unity, using Cg/HLSL and Unity&rsquo;s shader graph tool. We&rsquo;ll also create a sample scene in Unity to demonstrate the shaders.</p>

	<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
	<p>We&rsquo;ll make a simple demo scene in Unity with different types of geometry and some simple interaction. Our deliverables will be a playable Unity project and a video demo.</p>
	<p>Our metric for quality will be a combination of subjective aesthetic judgment, visual legibility of objects, and rendering framerate. We want to come up with shaders that look nice, but that also allow a viewer to clearly understand the geometry shown. Also, we would like to be able to render a scene in real time at 30 or 60 fps for interactive applications.</p>
	<p><b>Baseline plan:</b> We plan to come up with a few different stylized shaders and at least a simple static scene to render with our shaders. As inspiration, we&rsquo;re interested in replicating different cel shading styles from games like Breath of the Wild and Borderlands, but also playing with the code to come up with our own new approaches.</p>
	<p><b>Stretch goal:</b> We would like to expand on the scene and make it interactive; and combine the different styles we find into a more complex shader to render different objects with algorithms representing different materials. Our north star here is a game currently under development on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/@t3ssel8r/videos&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680679355926094&amp;usg=AOvVaw03pEoJ52DMGrgYt8__HVdh">a YouTube channel called t3ssel8r</a>. It has an awesome retro pixel-art style that looks like hand-drawn 2D sprites, but is actually rendered from 3D geometry. There&rsquo;s special handling of different objects like grass and water. We&rsquo;d love to figure out how this is done and replicate it or make our own style.</p>

	<h2>Schedule</h2>
	<p><b>Week 1:</b> Learn Cg/HLSL/Unity and research existing algorithms. Develop ideas for shaders</p>
	<p><b>Week 2:</b> Implement a few different shader ideas and a basic scene</p>
	<p><b>Week 3:</b> Further develop the Unity scene and expand on one or two specific shaders</p>
	<p><b>Week 4:</b> Put together all shaders with scene and create presentation</p>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<p><b>Software:</b> Unity, Cg/HLSL</p>
	<p><b>Hardware:</b> We want to run our Unity project on our laptops (Macbooks). This means no proprietary Nvidia tools.</p>

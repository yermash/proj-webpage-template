			* NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts
			to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words,
			you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part
			4).

			<p><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p>
				For part 2, we implemented the Microfacet model in order to model
				reflective materials like metals. This included writing formulas into
				code to produce and sample the model. We ran into a few bugs for this
				part, but we were able to overcome them. For part 4, we implemented a thin lens to simulate
				a depth of field effect. This required some overhauling of 3-1 and some rather interesting and complex geometry.
			</p>

			
			<br />

			<h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene
					`CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005,
					0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples
					per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at
					least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that,
					to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for
					`microfacet`.

				The value of alpha represents how rough the surface of the dragon is.
				For the lowest value, alpha = 0.005, the dragon's surface is very
				smooth. This produces a very glossy image in which the dragon's surface
				appears almost like a gold-tinted mirror. The dragon itself is also very
				noisy with many white dots. The background also has a large amount of
				white dots of noise. Raising it to alpha = 0.05, the dragon remains very
				glossy and mirror-like, but it has less noise and retains slightly more
				of its gold color. The noise in the background of the scene also
				decreases. Raising it to alpha = 0.25 makes significant change. The
				dragon is now much less glossy and no-longer appears like a mirror. The
				dragon's color is still very impacted by the blue and red colors of the
				walls, however. The background noise seems to be mostly gone. Raising
				the surface roughness to the maximum value of alpha = 0.5 makes the
				dragon appear in its least glossy and most golden state, with less (but
				sitll noticeable) blue and red color influence from the walls.

					Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using
					cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The
					sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples
					per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss
					their difference.

				The two sampling methods produce relatively similar backgrounds of the
				scene, with the walls, floor, and ceiling looking similar with white
				dots of noise. The importance sampling method we implemented, however,
				produces a significant improvement when it comes to the bunny itself.
				The bunny produced with cosine hemisphere sampling is covered in black
				dots of noise. Our sampling method produced a very shiny and smooth
				bunny, on the other hand.

					Show at least one image with some other conductor material, replacing

			<h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
			<b>
				For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show
				off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
			</b>
			<p>
				<b>
					In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera
					model and a thin-lens camera model.
				</b>
			</p>
			<p>The pinhole camera model (implemented in 3-1) is sort of an ideal model where light enters the camera through a miniscule pinhole.
				This implies that any ray of light that goes through the pinhole can only affect a single point or pixel in the scene (everything is automatically focused).
				On the other hand, a thin-lens model the light from the scene is refracted through the lens and can hit any number of pixels in the image which can blur and create focus/depth of field effects.

			<p><b>Collaboration Note</b></p>
			<p>
				Us Brandons have collaborated for every project and for every project
				this partnership has been mutually beneficial. We worked together on
				this project on the couch at our house, taking turns writing code. We
				learned that it's fun to code together.
